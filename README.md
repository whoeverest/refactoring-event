refactoring-event
=================

"Refactoring Event" is when people gather to refactor existing code.

Each pair of people starts with the same codebase as everyone else and they work to make it better. A "better" codebase in this context is one that:

* Has better test coverage than it had before
* Is shorter than it was before (not counting tests)
* It's functioning exactly like it was before

You are allowed to do anything you like with the code in order to make it "better".

The only rule is: **you mustn't break / change funcionality**

## Format

* 4 - 6 hours long, separated into 45 min. sessions
* Introduction, why refactoring is important, refactoring techniques (30 min)
* Coding sessions
* Food breaks
* At the end, teams present refactored code, techniques used and stats: LOC reduced, % test coverage; refactored code is tested on inputs / cases unknown to the participants
